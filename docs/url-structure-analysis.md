## Current Implementation Status ✅

Our current implementation already includes:

1. **IP-Based Detection**: Automatic language detection based on country
2. **Cookie Persistence**: User preferences saved in cookies
3. **Smart Fallbacks**: Browser language → IP location → Default (Turkish)
4. **Medical Tourism Priority**: Special handling for common medical tourism countries
5. **URL Consistency**: Language-prefixed URLs for SEO and sharing

### Example User Journey:
1. German patient visits site
2. IP detected as DE → German language
3. Redirected to `/de/services/hair-transplant`
4. Patient shares link with family → they see German version
5. Patient switches to English → URL becomes `/en/services/hair-transplant`
6. Preference saved in cookie for future visits

This approach provides the best user experience while maintaining SEO benefits and technical robustness.
