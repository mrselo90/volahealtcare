"BBL Detail","Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL)","A Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) is a cosmetic procedure that enhances the shape and volume of the buttocks by transferring fat from other areas of the body, such as the abdomen or thighs. The process involves liposuction to remove excess fat, which is then purified and re-injected into the buttocks to create a fuller, more natural-looking shape. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia, with minimal scarring. Recovery typically takes a few weeks, and results are long-lasting with proper aftercare. BBL provides a more defined, youthful, and proportional appearance.","wix:image://v1/e9f8ad_28db661d1ec04edba272d8a875a48506~mv2.jpg/12.jpg#originWidth=1080&originHeight=1080","Transform Your Silhouette with a Brazilian Butt Lift at Aesthetic Care Istanbul

The Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) is a highly sought-after cosmetic procedure designed to enhance the size, shape, and contour of the buttocks using your body’s natural fat. At Aesthetic Care Istanbul, we specialize in delivering exceptional BBL results, combining advanced techniques with world-class care to provide a more sculpted, curvier silhouette.

What is a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL)?
BBL is a dual-benefit procedure that involves liposuction to remove excess fat from areas such as the abdomen, thighs, or flanks, and fat transfer to the buttocks to create a fuller, more lifted appearance. Unlike implants, BBL uses your body’s natural fat, resulting in a more natural look and feel while reducing unwanted fat in other areas.

The Brazilian Butt Lift Process at Aesthetic Care Istanbul
At Aesthetic Care Istanbul, your journey begins with a personalized consultation to assess your goals and develop a customized treatment plan. Our expert surgeons use cutting-edge techniques to ensure the best possible outcomes, prioritizing safety and aesthetics.

Procedure Steps:
Liposuction: Fat is carefully removed from donor areas using advanced liposuction methods to sculpt the body while harvesting viable fat cells.
Purification: The harvested fat is purified to separate healthy fat cells from other materials, ensuring optimal results during the transfer process.
Fat Injection: The purified fat is strategically injected into specific areas of the buttocks to enhance volume, symmetry, and shape. This process ensures a natural, long-lasting result tailored to your desired look.
The procedure typically takes 2-4 hours under general anesthesia. Our surgeons use precise techniques to maximize fat survival rates and minimize risks.

Recovery and Results
Following a BBL at Aesthetic Care Istanbul, patients can expect some swelling and discomfort, which subside within a few weeks. Special care, such as avoiding direct pressure on the buttocks and wearing a compression garment, is essential during the recovery period to ensure optimal fat retention.

Most patients can return to light activities within a week and resume normal routines after 4-6 weeks. The final results become visible over the following months as swelling subsides and the fat cells integrate naturally into the body. The outcome is a more sculpted figure and enhanced buttocks, creating a balanced, attractive silhouette.

At Aesthetic Care Istanbul, we provide exceptional fat transfer services, combining expertise with state-of-the-art technology to achieve natural-looking, long-lasting results.

What is Fat Transfer to the Face?
Over time, the natural aging process causes a loss of fat and collagen in the face, leading to hollow cheeks, deep wrinkles, and a tired appearance. Fat transfer to the face addresses these concerns by removing fat from one area of the body—such as the abdomen, thighs, or flanks—and injecting it into targeted facial areas. This procedure enhances volume, smooths fine lines, and restores a youthful, radiant look.

The Process at Aesthetic Care Istanbul
At Aesthetic Care Istanbul, every fat transfer procedure is customized to meet the unique needs and goals of each patient. Our expert surgeons use meticulous techniques to ensure safe and aesthetically pleasing outcomes.

Procedure Steps:
Fat Harvesting: The procedure begins with liposuction to remove excess fat from a donor area of the body. Common areas include the abdomen, thighs, or hips.
Fat Purification: The harvested fat is carefully processed to isolate healthy fat cells for re-injection. This step ensures optimal results and minimizes risks.
Fat Injection: The purified fat is strategically injected into specific facial areas, such as the cheeks, under the eyes, nasolabial folds, or lips, to enhance volume, contour, and symmetry.
The entire process is typically performed under local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia, depending on the extent of the procedure. It usually takes 1-2 hours to complete.

Recovery and Results
Patients can expect mild swelling and bruising for the first few days following the procedure, which gradually subsides within a week or two. Most individuals can resume normal activities within a few days, although it’s advisable to avoid strenuous activities for at least two weeks.

The results of facial fat transfer are both natural-looking and long-lasting, with a portion of the transferred fat cells permanently integrating into the treated areas. As a result, patients enjoy a rejuvenated, youthful appearance that can last for years with proper care.

Benefits of Fat Transfer to the Face at Aesthetic Care Istanbul
Natural Enhancement: Using your body’s own fat ensures a natural look and feel.
Dual Benefit: The procedure not only rejuvenates the face but also contours the donor area through liposuction.
Safe and Effective: Performed by experienced surgeons using advanced techniques to minimize risks and maximize results.
Customized Care: Each procedure is tailored to the patient’s unique facial structure and aesthetic goals.

Anesthesia: Liposuction is performed under general or local anesthesia with sedation, ensuring a comfortable and pain-free experience.
Procedure: The surgeon makes small incisions near the treatment areas and inserts a thin tube called a cannula. Using advanced techniques, such as tumescent liposuction or VASER liposuction, fat is carefully loosened and removed. These methods minimize damage to surrounding tissues and enhance precision.
Sculpting: Our surgeons meticulously contour the treated areas to ensure smooth, natural-looking results.
The procedure typically lasts 1-4 hours, depending on the number and size of areas being treated.

The Root Canal Process at Aesthetic Care Istanbul
At Aesthetic Care Istanbul, our experienced dental professionals use state-of-the-art technology and techniques to ensure the success and comfort of your root canal treatment. Here’s what you can expect during the procedure:

Step 1: Diagnosis and Consultation
Your journey begins with a thorough dental examination, including X-rays, to identify the extent of the infection and assess the tooth’s condition. Our specialists explain the procedure in detail, ensuring you feel informed and confident before treatment begins.

Step 2: Preparing the Tooth
The treatment starts with the administration of local anesthesia to numb the affected area, ensuring a pain-free experience. The dentist then isolates the tooth to keep it dry and free from saliva during the procedure.

Step 3: Cleaning and Shaping the Root Canal
Using advanced tools, the infected or damaged pulp is carefully removed from the tooth's interior. The canals are then cleaned, disinfected, and shaped to prepare them for filling.

Step 4: Filling and Sealing
Once cleaned, the canals are filled with a biocompatible material called gutta-percha and sealed to prevent future infections. This step stabilizes the tooth and restores its integrity.

Step 5: Restoration
After the root canal procedure, the tooth often requires a dental crown to provide strength and protection. At Aesthetic Care Istanbul, we offer durable and aesthetically pleasing crowns to restore the tooth's functionality and appearance seamlessly.

Recovery and Aftercare
Following root canal treatment, patients may experience mild sensitivity, which typically subsides within a few days. Our team provides detailed aftercare instructions to ensure a smooth recovery.
